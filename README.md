### Project Title
Bikeshare(Udacity test)

### Description
This project analize bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, I write code to provide the following information:

1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

2 Popular stations and trip
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3 Trip duration
total travel time
average travel time

4 User info
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
To answer these questions using Python, you will need to write a Python script. To help guide your work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a bikeshare.py file, and you will do your scripting in there also. You will need the three city dataset files too:

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
